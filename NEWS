- MEMOPT type bug solved (i forget some copy)

Yass-1.12 [sept 2007 - december 2007]

- low complexity now does not interfer between threads ... global
variables were shared before.
- Gumbel Law Lambda and K are computed with full consideration of the
background nucleotide distribution for both sequences ...
- bug solved when left alignment was computed : some unreleavants
positions were added.

Yass-1.13
  "Houston, we've had a problem here"

Yass-1.14 (* : work done by Antoine DE MONTE) [january 2008 - january 2013]
* multifasta "full support" (for the first file too, with the "-S 0" parameter)
* multithreading improved, parametrized for the multifasta first file
* 64 bits support (files larger than 2Gb)
- PSL output format added
- bug solved on multiseed span linking
- bug solved on the rightmost alignments
- several bugs solved on the alignment_SG_Border part
- bug solved on the min_max_span of the default seed (inverted ?? does not appear in previous versions)
- bug on the "mask copy" (RedMask function)
- new implementation of the greedy "align tuples" functions
- bug on "-c 1" tuple size (was corrected during extention ... now solved during hit)
- many improvements in the "align.c" main method x 2 ... work in progress on this part ...
- most of the alignments are now provided by the heuristic "Border" functions (banded alignment) + 2 bugs solved on it
- output bug (on one case, indels were numbered ...)
- sort on %identity (query/text/alignment) added 
- hash cache table removed (not used)
- parser modified (bug on inner '>' when fasta file is incorrectly formatted) + memory on header kept
- bug on single file extention (when following the main diagonal)
- autotools "-lm" option changed from LDFLAGS to LIBS (does not change the compiled version ...)
- heuritic "improved" on resolve_overlaps "hits" (more DP-Alignment is done when this case occurs :
  this do not apply however on non resolve_overlaps "hits" that are thus "seed pattern dependent".

Yass-1.15 : [january 2013 - april 2020]
- Small improvement on first file (query) index on multifasta : avoid the "more than quadratic time" (due to reuse of kword first index)
  it is better than before, but no still perfect has it does not build index on multifasta file into a single index.
- dereferencing pointer compiler warning fixed
- bug on the index "imask" overflow fixed (not detected before : compiler issue ?)
- small bug on bad Entropy value (small difference) fixed (found by Aude Darrack), fixed in 1.15 [november 2014]
- not a bug: some warning added on the seed pattern when bad ones are in the input
- First hit (tuple) selection [Ongoing]
- Disabling the assemble_align thread at very first time, or for small sequences [august 2015]
- Fixing a regroup scoring evaluation (optimistic way with overlaps) + a regroup window increment
- Patching a Resolve_Overlap annoying Bug [april 2016]
- Patching a Lazy Alignment large indel Bug + some valgrind [may 2016]
- Changing the behavior of -s 6x to avoid redudancy with -s 4x [august 2016]
  Now similar to -s 7x (BLAST), with the difference that the queries blocks
  are not kept in the same order as input, but ordered by their best overall score ...
- Solving some memory leak, uninitialized value, and a bug in "regroup.c": cleaning on customer but not on producer [december 2016]

â€“ Correct penalty for negative overlap between two alignments [september 2018]
- Separating the "MAminscore" (evolving when too many alignemnts) and the "TUminscore" (to start an alignment) [september 2018]
- When saturation occurs, updating the "MAminscore" to remove alignments that were previously computed, but are under the saturation filter, and filter it before regroup occurs to get homogeneous results [january 2019]
- When grouping selction occurs, use the main queue in both directions, with a "last element" trick to search inside the main queue (does not change the algorithm, but its complexity) [march 2019]
- Score used to upgrade tuples was reconsidered and set to its worst case [march 2019]
- yass2dotplot.php added for Offline Dotplot Work [april 2020]
